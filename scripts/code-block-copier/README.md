# Code Block Copier

## What is Code Block Copier?

Code Block Copier is a JavaScript userscript that enables users to copy code in codeblocks (snippets or not) directly to their clipboard via a simple click without having to 
select. This is a novel solution to manually selecting the block, which can be tiring.

## How do I use it?

Once you have installed the script (see **Installation** below), go to [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). If your browser supports the extension, you should see the following:

Make sure to click 'Ok.' Then navigate to any code block and hover over it. You should see a little clipboard icon come up in the bottom right corner, like below:

Click on the icon. If it turns into a checkmark, then the code was successfully copied to your clipboard.
