# User Interaction Blocker

## User Interaction Blocker

User Interaction Blocker helps prevent accidental voting fraud and other accidents that could result in a ban when using multiple accounts by disabling interactions between two accounts.

**Known Issue:** Due to the support of duplicate usernames, we all currently adding user id support which will get rid of accidentally blocking other users.

## How do I use it?

Once you have installed the script (see **Installation** below), go to [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).

To add blocked users, enter **Control + Shift + Enter**. To add a blocked user, enter the user's username into the input, then **press ENTER**. *Then* click 'Save'. If you enter a username into the input and click 'Save' directly, your changes will not be applied.

To test that it works, try voting up or down on a blocked user's question or answer. A notice should appear saying "You have disabled user interactions with this user."
